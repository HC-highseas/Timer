# Timer
This Timer website project is inspired by a trending CodePen example that caught my attention recently. Although it is a simple project, I was captivated by its design and functionality, which motivated me to create my own version. I liked the idea and aesthetics so much that I decided to build an exact replica. While developing this project, I referred to the CodePen example whenever I needed guidance or clarity. This project is a reflection of my learning process and an attempt to recreate something I found inspiring, while also enhancing my understanding of web development concepts.
